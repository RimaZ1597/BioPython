biopython is set of freely avaliable tools which will be used for biological computation.
in biopython we can deal with dna and rna seq.
it is completly written in python.

how to install biopython:-
----------------------
pip3 install biopython

function in python:-
------------------------------
function is block of code which takes the input do some specific operation and produces the output
if we create the function then we will not required to write same code again and again instead of writeing same code we have to call the function.

two types of function:-
-------------------
1)inbuilt function :- the function already present in python len() ,count(),replace()

2)user defined function :- user can create our own function .


def function_name():       #function defination 
	block of code      #function body

function_name()            #function calling


function is block of code which only run when we call the function .
function calling is done by function name

we can also pass the parameter inside function:-

def function_name(parameter1,parameter2....):
	block of code 

function_name()


def functttion_name(paraemters..):
	return  operation

function_name()

class:- 
--------------
class is group of attributes and methods

what is attributes:-
-------------------
it is represented by variable 
a=90

what us methods?
------------------
it performs action or task.it is similar to function.  .count() .replace()  len() 


object:- 
-------------
it is collection of data and methdso which act on those data


class --> sketch of house  
it contains info about doors floorr etc..
using this info we can build the house that house is called object.


class class_name:
	attributes
	methods
	
object_name=class_name()     #this is way to create the object

in class and object  there will be some reserved methods and reserved keywords are present:-

1)__init__():- this methods is used to initialise the attributes from class
this method is auctomatically getting called when we create the object of class

2)self :- to access the data from attributes.

modules:-
---------------
module is python file which contains python defination and statements.

import keyword is used to import ay module

import module_name
